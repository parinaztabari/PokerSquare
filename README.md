# Poker Squares

These Python scripts implement two poker square agents: a random player and a pure Monte Carlo Tree Search-based agent.

Inspired by: https://github.com/chetaldrich/pokersquares

The Monte Carlo Tree Search implementation was obtained from the repository at: https://github.com/ImparaAI/monte-carlo-tree-search
